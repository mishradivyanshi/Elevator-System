# Caizin Interns Repository

Welcome to the **Caizin Internship Training Repository** 🎓

This repo is where all interns submit their assignments and projects.
Each intern has their own folder to keep work isolated and organized.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
```
caizin-interns-2025/
 ├── nikhil/
 ├── yash/
 ├── abhinash/
 └── ...
```

Each intern should work **only inside their own folder**.
